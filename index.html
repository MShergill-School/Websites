  <h2>About Mars</h2>
  <p>
  The fourth planet from the Sun is Mars. 
  It has a thin atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide and is extremely dry and cold (NASA, 2023). 
  Without specialized equipment, people cannot breathe due to the extremely low air pressure. especially in close proximity of the poles, the temperature can drop significantly.
  People living on Mars would be more exposed to space radiation because the planet lacks a strong magnetic field. 
  Mars's gravity is only around one-third that of Earth, which over time can weaken bones and muscles. 
  Homes on Mars must be extremely well-built to ensure people's safety due to the harsh conditions (NASA, 2023).

  <h2>Food Production</h2>
  <p>
    Plants on Mars will be grown using hydroponics—growing them in nutrient-rich water instead of soil, since Martian soil lacks nutrients. 
    LED lights will help the plants grow, and waste will be minimized through water and nutrient recycling. 
    Radiation and lower gravity will affect plant growth. 
    Advanced greenhouses with sensors and computers will monitor and adjust light, water, and nutrients for optimal growth.
    Science Connection: This connects to the sustainable ecosystems and climate change unit because hydroponics creates a mini ecosystem where plants recycle water and carbon dioxide, helping support life on Mars like ecosystems do on Earth (NASA, 2014).
  </p>
  <p>
    Advanced greenhouses may use automated sensors and AI to monitor plant health and adjust lighting, humidity, and nutrients, ensuring reliable food supplies for colonists.

  <h2>Oxygen Systems</h2>
  <p>
    MOXIE is a machine on a Mars rover that turns carbon dioxide into oxygen by heating it and separating it into oxygen and carbon monoxide. 
    While it currently makes only small amounts of oxygen, larger versions will be needed for human breathing and rocket fuel. 
    Bringing oxygen from Earth is too expensive and heavy. 
    Another idea is using algae to produce oxygen through photosynthesis.
    Science Connection: This connects to the elements and the periodic table unit because oxygen is an element, and carbon dioxide is a compound made of two elements. It shows how elements can be separated and reused (NASA, 2023).
  </p>
  <p>
    Backup life support systems might include biological solutions like algae-based bioreactors, where photosynthetic organisms generate oxygen and recycle carbon dioxide, creating a sustainable air supply within habitats.

  <h2>Energy Sources</h2>
  <p>
    While Solar power is still a viable source of energy for Mars, it receives less sunlight than Earth. Dust storms in Mars occur quite often during some seasons, and if solar panels are not regularly cleaned, the dust settles on them for days or weeks blocking sunlight (ESA, 2023). 
    Alternatively, Kilopower is a nuclear reactor, though very small. It employs heat from nuclear reactions to keep creating electricity continuously. 
    Kilopower reactors create enough electricity for the sustenance of habitats even if solar panels are malfunctioning. 
    Hence, there will always be energy on Mars from the solar and nuclear power(ESA, 2023).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nuclear power offers a high energy density and reliability, critical for long-duration missions and Mars' harsh environment.

  <h2>Water & Waste Recycling</h2>
  <p>
    Water is rare on Mars, so recycling is essential. 
    Systems will collect water from sweat, urine, and air humidity, clean it, and make it reusable. 
    Urine will be treated to recover water and nutrients. 
    This supports drinking, hygiene, and plant growth in greenhouses, and reduces the need to transport water from Earth.
    Science Connection: This connects to the physical and chemical properties of matter unit because the water is changed physically (filtered and boiled) and chemically (cleaned of waste), showing how matter is transformed and reused (Jones et al., 2015).
  </p>
  <p>
    Such recycling not only conserves water but also supports nutrient cycling in hydroponic farms, closing the loop on life support systems necessary for sustainable Mars colonies.
