  <h2>About Mars</h2>
  <p>
  The fourth planet from the Sun is Mars. 
  It has a thin atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide and is extremely dry and cold (NASA, 2023). 
  Without specialized equipment, people cannot breathe due to the extremely low air pressure. especially in close proximity of the poles, the temperature can drop significantly.
  People living on Mars would be more exposed to space radiation because the planet lacks a strong magnetic field. 
  Mars's gravity is only around one-third that of Earth, which over time can weaken bones and muscles. 
  Homes on Mars must be extremely well-built to ensure people's safety due to the harsh conditions (NASA, 2023).

  <h2>Food Production</h2>
  <p>
    The hydroponic growing method will be used on Mars for growing plants, whereby plants develop in nutrient water and not in soil. 
    Mars' soil conditions are detrimental to plant life and lack nutrients, plants cannot develop in such soil directly. 
    Plants will be illuminated with LED actinic light (NASA, 2014). 
    In this water and nutrient circulation, wastes will be avoided. 
    Understanding plant growth will be affected by significantly higher radiation and lower gravity than on Earth (NASA, 2014). 
    Sensors and computers will be installed in the new greenhouses to monitor and control light and water levels to provide the best conditions for plant growth (NASA, 2014).
  </p>
  <p>
    Advanced greenhouses may use automated sensors and AI to monitor plant health and adjust lighting, humidity, and nutrients, ensuring reliable food supplies for colonists.

  <h2>Oxygen Systems</h2>
  <p>
    The Mars rover's MOXIE machine converts carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the planet into oxygen. 
    The carbon dioxide is heated and separated into carbon monoxide and oxygen (NASA, 2023). 
    At the moment, MOXIE produces a tiny quantity of oxygen that astronauts could use for brief excursions outside. 
    Larger devices like MOXIE will eventually need to produce a lot more oxygen for human consumption and rocket fuel. 
    Because it would be very costly and heavy to transport oxygen from Earth, it is crucial to produce it on Mars. 
    Utilizing algae that generate oxygen through photosynthesis is an additional concept (NASA, 2023).
  </p>
  <p>
    Backup life support systems might include biological solutions like algae-based bioreactors, where photosynthetic organisms generate oxygen and recycle carbon dioxide, creating a sustainable air supply within habitats.

  <h2>Energy Sources</h2>
  <p>
    While Solar power is still a viable source of energy for Mars, it receives less sunlight than Earth. Dust storms in Mars occur quite often during some seasons, and if solar panels are not regularly cleaned, the dust settles on them for days or weeks blocking sunlight (ESA, 2023). 
    Alternatively, Kilopower is a nuclear reactor, though very small. It employs heat from nuclear reactions to keep creating electricity continuously. 
    Kilopower reactors create enough electricity for the sustenance of habitats even if solar panels are malfunctioning. 
    Hence, there will always be energy on Mars from the solar and nuclear power(ESA, 2023).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nuclear power offers a high energy density and reliability, critical for long-duration missions and Mars' harsh environment.

  <h2>Water & Waste Recycling</h2>
  <p>
    Recycling water is crucial because it is extremely scarce on Mars. 
    Mars's systems will gather water from perspiration, urine, and the humidity of the air within the habitats. 
    After cleaning and filtering, the water will be safe to use once more. Water and nutrients will be restored through urine treatment. 
    Recycling water helps people have enough to drink, wash, and feed greenhouse plants (Jones et al., 2015). 
    Life on Mars is made easier by these recycling systems, which reduce the amount of water that must be transported from Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such recycling not only conserves water but also supports nutrient cycling in hydroponic farms, closing the loop on life support systems necessary for sustainable Mars colonies.
